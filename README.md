# YouChef

YouChef helps you make the most of the ingredients you already have at home. By inputting even just a few   of the staples in your pantry or fridge, you can find hundreds of recipes. 



The app utilizes AJAX and JSON to fetch recipe information from sites all over the web. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery lending a hand here and there.
